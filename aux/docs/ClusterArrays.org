#+title: ~WireCell::Aux::ClusterArrays~

Provides array representations of ~ICluster~.

The ~ICluster~ graph represents the complex connection and attributes of
five types of objects.  In addition to graph edges providing inter
object referencing, these objects reference other objects internally
leading to an even more complex graph.  The ~ClusterArrays~ class
"flattens" the attributes and their relationship into a set of arrays.
This document describes the ~ClusterArrays~ interface and give guidance
on how to use the array its produces.

* Low-level array representation

The API provides arrays in the form of [[https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_79_0/libs/multi_array/doc/user.html][Boost.MultiArray]] types.

* Array schema

The array schema closely matches that provided by the python-geometric
~HeteroData~ interface.  It factors into *node array* and *edge array*
schema.


** Node array schema

An ~ICluster~ graph node of one of a fixed set of *node types* (/channel,
wire, blob, slice, measure/).  The first letter of the type name is
the *node type code*.  Each node type has exactly one array schema.

The order of the rows in a node array follows the order in the
~ICluster~ node collection.  The meaning of each column of each node
type is described in the following subsection.  Some column types are
inherently integer but are represented precisely as ~double~ and are
marked with "(int)".

Take care that the enumerated lists below are 1-based counts, one more
than the 0-based array indices.

*** Channel

A channel represents an amount of signal collected from its attached
wire segments over the duration of a time slice.

1. /ident/, (int) channel ID as defined in the "wires" file
2. /value/, the central value of the signal
3. /uncertainty/, the uncertainty in the value
4. /index/, (int) the channel index
5. /wpid/, (int) the wire plane id

*** Wire

The wire array reproduces purely static "geometric" information about
physical wire segments.

1. /ident/, (int) the application determined ID number.
2. /wip/, (int) the wire-in-plane (WIP) index.
3. /segment/, (int) the number of segments between this wire segment and the channel input.
4. /channel/, (int) the channel ID (not row index).
5. /plane/, (int) the plane ID (not necessarily a plane index).
6. /tailx/, the x coordinate of the tail endpoint of the wire.
7. /taily/, the y coordinate of the tail endpoint of the wire.
8. /tailz/, the z coordinate of the tail endpoint of the wire.
9. /headx/, the x coordinate of the head endpoint of the wire.
10. /heady/, the y coordinate of the head endpoint of the wire.
11. /headz/, the z coordinate of the head endpoint of the wire.


*** Blob

A blob describes a volume in space bounded in the longitudinal
direction by the duration of a time slice and in the transverse
directions by pairs of wires from each plane and with an associated
signal contained by this region.

1. /ident/, (int) the application determined ID number.
2. /value/, the central value of the signal
3. /uncertainty/, the uncertainty in the value
4. /faceid/, (int) the face ident from ~WirePlaneId(kUnkownLayer,face,apa)~
5. /sliceid/, (int) the slice ident
6. /start/, the start time of the blob
7. /span/, the time span of the blob
8. /min1/, (int) the WIP providing lower bound of the blob in plane 1.
9. /max1/, (int) the WIP providing upper bound of the blob in plane 1.
10. /min2/, (int) the WIP providing lower bound of the blob in plane 2.
11. /max2/, (int) the WIP providing upper bound of the blob in plane 2.
12. /min3/, (int) the WIP providing lower bound of the blob in plane 3.
13. /max3/, (int) the WIP providing upper bound of the blob in plane 3.
14. /ncorners/, (int) the number of corners
15. 24 columns holding /corners as (y,z) pairs/, 12 pairs, of which /ncorners/ are valid.

*** Slice

A slice represents a duration in drift/readout time.

1. /ident/, (int) the application determined ID number.
2. /value/, the central value of the signal.
3. /uncertainty/, the uncertainty in the value.
4. /frameid/, (int) the frame ident number
5. /start/, the start time of the slice.
6. /span/, the duration time of the slice.

The ~ISlice~ also holds the "activity map" mapping channels in slice to charge.


*** Measure

A measure represents the collection of channels in a given plane
connected to a set of wires that span a blob in one wire plane.
Its signal is the sum of channel signals.

1. /ident/, (int) the application determined ID number.
2. /value/, the central value of the signal.
3. /uncertainty/, the uncertainty in the value.
4. /wpid/, the wire plane ID

** Edge array schema

~ICluster~ does not associate any data with edges and so only
connectivity information is covered by the edge array schema.  There
is one type of array with two columns, each providing an index into a
node array of an endpoint of the edge.  Index is represented in type
~int~.

Each *edge array* spans the edges of one *edge type*.  The edge type is
defined as the combination of the *node type codes* (see above) of nodes
which the edge connects.  The combination is formed so that the codes
are in alphabetical order and this order is reflected in the order of
the columns.  For example if one has an edge array of type ~bs~
(blob-slice) then the first column of the array holds row indices into
the blob type node array and the second column holds row indices into
the slice type node array.  The rows of edge arrays follow the order
of edges in the ~ICluster~ graph.


* Implementation

The ~ClusterArrays~ class will convert ~ICluster~ to arrays following
above schema.  See ~ClusterFileSink::numpify()~ for example usage.

A test:

#+begin_example
wire-cell -l stdout -L debug -A detector=pdsp \
          -c img/test/depo-ssi-viz.jsonnet
#+end_example

That test and some plotting can be run as:

#+begin_example
snakemake -j6 -s img/test/depo-ssi-viz.smake all
#+end_example
