#+title: Wire-Cell Toolkit Tensor Set Data Model
#+setupfile: ../../util/docs/setup-note.org

* Introduction

This document defines the Wire-Cell Toolkit (WCT) /tensor data model/.
It factors into two layers: "generic" and "specific".

The /generic tensor data model/ defines a tensor as a numeric array with
an associated metadata object and an ordered collection (set) of such
tensor objects.  The WCT data interface classes ~ITensor~ and ~ITensorSet~
embody these two aspects. 

The /specific tensor data model/ defines conventions on the generic
tensor data model in order to map certain other data types to the
generic tensor data model. 

The next two sections define the generic and specific tensor data
models and are written in rfc2119 language.

* Generic tensor data model

** Tensor

A *tensor* shall be composed of two conceptual parts: an *array* part and
a *metadata* (MD) part.

The *array* part consists of a sequence of elements that shall be stored
contiguously and associated with a *shape*, layout *order* and element
*type* and *size*.

The array *shape* shall be represented as a vector of integer type with
each element corresponding to the number of elements spanned by the
corresponding dimension.
The array layout *order* shall be represented as a vector which stores
the majority of the dimensions or it shall be empty indicating "C"
layout.  A "C" layout should be used.
The array element *type* shall be represented as a string with values
following Numpy [[https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.interface.html#arrays-interface][array interface]] ~typestr~ specification.  This typically
means a letter followed by a number giving the size in bytes of the
type.
The array element *size* shall be represented as an integer providing
the size of one element measured in bytes.

A tensor *metadata* (MD) part shall follow the JSON data model and be of
JSON type /object/.  The model reserves the following attributes names.

- array :: optional and when existing it is an object providing array
  specifications using keyword names given in bold above (*shape*, etc).
Additional MD attributes are required by the specific tensor data
model.  User application may define attributes not otherwise reserved
here.  The MD must be faithfully passed through any tensor converter
round trip.

A *tensor set* shall be composed of two conceptual parts: an ordered
sequence of tensors and a metadata part.  A tensor set shall not
contain other tensor sets.
The ordering of a tensor set sequence shall be stable and may be
empty.  A tensor may be contained in multiple tensor sets.
The tensor set MD object shall follow the JSON data model and be of
JSON type object but otherwise this tensor data model places no
requirements on its contents.  The tensor set MD must be faithfully
passed through any tensor set converter round trip.

* Specific tensor data model

The specific tensor data model defines a number of complex specific
data types in terms of the generic tensor data model.  

** Common metadata conventions

A tensor MD shall have an attribute named *datapath* of type string that
identifies the tensor in a logical hierarchical structure of multiple
tensors.  The *datapath* value shall be unique among all tensors held in
a tensor set.  The value shall be interpreted as a sequence of atomic
identifiers separated by a ~"/"~ (slash) character.  An atomic
identifier must be valid for use as a name of C++ or Python variables
or functions.  A *datapath* value may be stored in a tensor MD attribute
and refer to another tensor when both tensors are held in the same
tensor set.

A tensor MD shall have an attribute *datatype* which is identifies a
data type in the specific tensor data model that it represents.  The
*datatype* value shall be one from the set of specific types described
below.  Additional requirements on MD attributes may be defined that
are specific to a *datatype* as described in the corresponding section
below.

Complex data types may be represented as an *aggregation* of multiple
tensors.  These shall be defined on a per data type basis below as a
set of MD attributes providing *datapath* values.

** Overview of specific types

The following specific types are mapped to the basic tensor data
model.  Each item in the list gives the *datatype* MD attribute value
and describes the WCT data type to which it associates.

- pcarray :: a ~PointCloud::Array~
- pcdataset :: a ~PointCloud::Dataset~
- pcgraph :: a ~PointGraph~

- trace :: one ~ITrace~ as 1D array or multiple ~ITrace~ as 2D array.
- tracedata :: tagged trace indices and summary data
- frame :: an ~IFrame~ as aggregate of traces and/or traceblocks

- cluster :: an ~ICluster~ 
The specific requirements for each data type are given in the
following sections in terms of their tensor array and metadata and in
some cases in terms of other types defined previously.

** pcarray

The *datatype* of *pcarray* indicates a tensor representing one
~PointCloud::Array~.
The tensor array information shall map directly to that of ~Array~.
A *pcarray* places no additional requirements on its tensor MD.

** pcdataset

The *datatype* of *pcdataset* indicates a tensor representing on
~PointCloud::Dataset~.
The tensor array shall be empty.
The tensor MD shall have the following attributes:

- arrays :: an object representing the named arrays.  Each attribute
  name provides the array name and each attribute value provides a
  *datapath* to a tensor of type *pcarray* holding the named array.
Additional user application ~Dataset~ metadata may reside in the tensor
MD.

** pcgraph

The *datatype* of *pcgraph* indicates a tensor representing a "point cloud
graph".  This extends a point cloud to include relationships between
pairs of points.  The array part of a *pcgraph* tensor shall be empty.
The MD part of a *pcgraph* tensor shall provide reference to two
*pcdataset* instances with the following MD attributes:

- nodes :: a *datapath* refering to a *pcdataset* representing graph vertex features.

- edges :: a *datapath* refering to a *pcdataset* representing graph edges and their features.

In addition, the *pcdataset* referred to by the *edges* attribute shall
provide two arrays of integer type with names *tails* and *heads*.  Each
shall provide indices into the *nodes* point cloud representing the tail
and head endpoint of graph edges.  A node or edge dataset may be
shared between different *pcgraph* instances.

** trace

The *datatype* of *trace* indicates a tensor representing a single ~ITrace~
or a collection of ~ITrace~ which have been combined.

The tensor array shall represent the samples over a contiguous period
of time from traces.

The tensor array shall have dimensionality of one when representing a
single ~ITrace~.  A collection of ~ITrace~ shall be represented with a
two-dimensional array with each row representing one or more traces
from a common channel.  In such a case, the full trace content
associated with a given channel may be represented by one or more
rows.

The array element type shall be either ~"i2"~ (~int16_t~) or ~"f4"~ (~float~)
depending on if ADC or signals are represented, respectively.

The tensor MD may include the attribute *tbin* with integer value and
providing the number of sample periods (ticks) between the frame
reference time and the first sample (column) in the array.

** tracedata

The *datatype* of *tracedata* provides per-trace information for a subset
of.  It is similar to a *pcdataset* and in fact may carry that value as
the *datatype* but it requires the following differences.

It defines additional MD attributes:

- tag :: optional, a trace tag.  If omitted or empty string, dataset must span total trace ordering.

The following array names are recognized:

- chid :: channel ident numbers for the traces.

- index :: provides indices into the total trace ordering.  

- summary :: trace summary values.

A chid value is require for every trace.  If the *tracedata* has no *tag*
then a *chid* array spanning the total trace ordering must be provided
and neither *index* nor *summary* is recognized.  If the *tracedata* has a
*tag* it must provide an *index* array and may provide a *summary* array and
may provide a *chid* array each corresponding to the traces identified
by *index*.

** frame

The *datatype* of *frame* represents an ~IFrame~.

The tensor array shall be empty.

The tensor MD aggregates tensors of datatype *trace* and *tracedata* and
provides other values as listed;

- ident :: the frame ident number (required)

- tags :: an array of string giving frame tags

- time :: the reference time of the frame (required)

- tick :: the sample period of the traces (required)

- masks :: channel mask map (optional)
  
- traces :: a sequence of datapath references to tensors of datatype *trace*.  The order of this sequence, along with the order of rows in any 2D *trace* tensors determines the /total order of traces/.

- tracedata :: a sequence of datapath references to tensors of datatype *tracedata*

In converting an ~IFrame~ to a *frame* tensor the sample values may be
truncated to *type* ~"i2"~.

A frame tensor of type ~"i2"~ shall have its sample values inflated to
type ~float~ when converted to an ~IFrame~.

** cluster

A ~cluster~ is a ~pcgraph~ with convention for how to serialize each of
its node types as described here.

*** wire

*** channel

*** measure

*** blob

*** slice

* Similarity to HDF5

The data model is intentionally similar to HDF5 abstract data model
and there is a conceptual mapping between the two:

#+begin_center
HDF5 group hierarchy

$\leftrightarrow$ 

~ITensor~ metadata attribute providing a hierarchy path as array of string.
#+end_center

#+begin_center
HDF5 group 

$\leftrightarrow$ 

No direct equivalent but an ~ITensor~ with no array is effectively the same.
#+end_center

#+begin_center
HDF5 dataset

$\leftrightarrow$ 

~ITensor~ array.
#+end_center

#+begin_center
HDF5 dataspace and datatype

$\leftrightarrow$ 

~ITensor~ methods ~shape()~, ~dtype()~, etc.
#+end_center

#+begin_center
HDF5 group or dataset attribute

$\leftrightarrow$ 

~ITensor~ metadata attribute
#+end_center
