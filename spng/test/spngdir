# This is a variant of the "spdir" workflow that adds an additional SP subgraph
# with sigproc components replaced with spng components and includes comparing
# between them.  It retains the "dir" name as the data content starts as depos
# from ideal MIP tracks at fixed directions relative to the wire plane normal.
#
# It also differs in that wire-cell jobs do not rely on the "omnijob.jsonnet"
# file but instead use the new omni object scheme.
