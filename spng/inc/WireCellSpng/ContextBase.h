/** The SPNG::ContextBase provides configurable torch device and semaphore.
 *
 * It is expected that every SPNG data flow graph node that performs torch
 * operations will inherit from ContexBase.
 *
 * The ContexBase is an IConfigurable.  Any subclass that is itself a component
 * must include IConfigurable interface in the subclass's WIRECELL_FACTORY()
 * macro call.
 *
 * A subclass that is itself configurable must combine the result of the
 * ContextBase's default_configuration() return to its own and must forward the
 * configuration object received by its own configure() method to that method on
 * the ContextBase.
