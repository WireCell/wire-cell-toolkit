/** ChargeSolving solves for charge in blobs.

    This attempts to faithfully implement the algorithms from the
    original Wire-Cell Prototype version:
    
    https://github.com/BNLIF/wire-cell-2dtoy/blob/master/src/ChargeSolving.cxx

    It includes these features:

    - uses channel charge and its uncertainty.

    - configurable threshold on the amount of charge for a measurement to be considered.

    - uses b-m connectivity to separate the solving to smaller problems.

    - solving uses b-weights based on b-b connectivity.

    - a Cholsky decomposition "whitening" of the matrices to accomodate LassoModel solver issues.
