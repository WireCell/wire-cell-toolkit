#+title: Example activities 3

The file [[file:activities3.txt]] represents activities run through
~check_act2viz~ to produce [[file:activities3-act2viz.txt]] and through the
full imaging to produce [[activities3-full.txt]].  Both should have used a
nudge of 0.01.

* Issues

As discovered by Haiwang, several issues are found

- Many of the blobs have a layer L1 bounds of ~[1,1]~.  Both L0 and L1 should always have bounds ~[0,1]~.

- 3 more blobs are found in "full" than "act2viz".

- Some blobs found by "act2viz" have more corners than those in "full"

* Suspicions

- "act2viz" uses wires that were generated from angles/pitches
  matching(?) microboone while "full" uses the microboone wires file
  (plus corrections).  Differences in these two wire sets may be
  implicated in some of the differences.

- The missing L1 boundary may be getting lost due it being pruned when
  it does not contribute to any corners.  If so, pruning should
  probably simply not touch L0 and L1.

* Tests

Here holds some notes on the tests.  All may be run with:

#+begin_example
bats util/test/test_tiling.bats
bats util/test/test_tiling_uboone.bats
#+end_example

First uses ideal, generated wires and second uses microboone wires
file with corrections.

Or, each test can be run individually by giving the test title

#+begin_example
bats -f "the listed test name" util/test/test_tiling.bats
#+end_example

** reproduce act2vis blob finding

Just works

** reproduce full blob finding

This is approximately 

** no missing bounds

All strips should have finite width.  In particular, L0 and L1 were
having bounds like ~[0,0]~ or ~[1,1]~.

- fix: simply do not prune on L0/L1
- fix: extend ~Blob::valid()~ to fail any blobs with width-less strips.
