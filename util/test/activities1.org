#+title: Example activities 1

The file [[file:activities1.txt]] is dumped using the ~operator<<(ostream&,
activities_t)~ operator for one example that shows some problem in a
past version tiling.

It is processed as

#+begin_example
./wcb -p --notests install
./wcb --target=check_act2viz
./build/util/check_act2viz util/test/activities1.txt act1.svg
firefox act1.svg
#+end_example

A copy of that SVG file may be found [[https://www.phy.bnl.gov/~bviren/tmp/wctimg/act1.svg][here]] (or may not).  Some features of these SVGs:

- An "activity" given to the tiling algorithm is represented as a
  polygon with black outline and colored according to plane (0=red,
  1=blue, 2=green).  The activity is centered on the "wire" or "strip"
  and thus its black outine represents the "half pitch" boundary.

- Clicking on a wire will return the SVG to full view (see below for
  zooms).

- Mouse-over a wire gives its identifying numbers: plane,
  wire-in-plane (~wip~), wire ident (~wid~) and wire count number (~wcn~).

- A blob is represented as a yellow polygon.

- You may click on a blob to zoom to that region.  With small blobs in
  large detectors you may need to first use your browser's usual zoom
  in order to resolve the blob area enough to click.  After the SVG
  redraws you may then need to return your browser to default zoom
  level.

- Each blob has an anchor link.  This allows easy sharing of a detail.
  For example, here is [[https://www.phy.bnl.gov/~bviren/tmp/wctimg/act1.svg#blob1][blob 1]].

- The corner of blobs are represented by black dots with white
  outlines.

- Mousing over a blob corner gives a pair of ~(layer,wip)~ numbers.
  Layers 0/1 provide constraints on overall horiz/vert active area and
  so the layer number is not the plane number:

|-------+-------+-------|
| layer | plane | desc  |
|-------+-------+-------|
|     0 |     - | horiz |
|     1 |     - | vert  |
|     2 |     0 | U     |
|     3 |     1 | V     |
|     4 |     2 | W     |
|-------+-------+-------|
