#+title: Guidance on using Boost Graph

* Vertices

Behavior greatly depends on the vertex container.  Note: LLMs get all this WRONG
even when they are pushed!  What follows is understood to be true by looking at
Boost Graph source and writing/running tests.

** vecS

- graph has vertex_index_t and is a built-in property map

- user can chose the integer type but can not set values

- graph uses index.

- graph stores a vertex_ptr in a vector.  the descriptor is an (the?) index.

** setS

- graph has no built-in index but one may be provided.

- user can chose the integer type and can set values

- graph does not use the index.

- graph stores a vertex_ptr in a set.  the descriptor is the pointer.
