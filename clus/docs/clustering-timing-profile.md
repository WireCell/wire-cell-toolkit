# SBND clustering timing profile (lan-reco2 reprocess) — optimization targets

**Purpose.** Per-event, per-stage wall-time breakdown of the SBND all-APA clustering
chain, taken from the `input-3files-lan-reco2` reprocess (150 real BNB+cosmic data
events). Identifies *which clustering stage* is slow and *which events* dominate, so
the optimization work can be targeted. **Numbers below are LOCKED from the final
150-event auto_mask-on reprocess (2026-06-04, `f{1,2,3}on/match.log`).**

> **⚠ Provenance (2026-06-05): the §"Headline" clustering numbers below were measured on
> yuhw's pre-imaged `*-active.npz` (foreign live input), which we have since stopped using
> ([[feedback_own_imaging_only]]). Our own local multi-3view active imaging changes the
> clustering input, so those per-stage/per-event clustering shares are expected to shift and
> should be treated as FOREIGN-INPUT BASELINE pending a re-pull from a crash-clean
> local-imaging run. The new §0 imaging numbers below ARE from our own local imaging.**

## 0. Imaging time & memory (our own local imaging, 2026-06-05)

Measured on file 1 of `input-3files-lan-reco2` (50 real data events), imaging active+dead
blobs ourselves from the SP frames — no foreign npz. Two separate wire-cell processes,
each wrapped by `profrun.sh` (polls `/proc/PID/status` `VmHWM` for peak RSS); wall from the
process log timestamp span.

| stage | what | wall (50 evt) | per-event | peak RSS |
|---|---|--:|--:|--:|
| **active imaging** | `wct-img-all.jsonnet` (multi-3view + full_deghost, both APAs) | **~382 s** | ~7.6 s | **1131 MB** |
| **matching process** | dead imaging + per-APA + all-APA clustering + QLMatching | ~658 s | ~13 s | 985 MB |

The active-imaging job (multi-3view + `full_deghost` = ProjectionDeghosting ×2 + 3×
ChargeSolving + 3× InSliceDeghosting per APA) is the heavier standalone imaging step and is
where W-plane dead-channel charge recovery happens. Dead/masked imaging is folded into the
matching process (in-graph) and is not separately timed here. Within the matching process,
**QLMatching itself is ~369 s (~56 %)** — see `match/docs/chisquare_flags_comparison.md` §17
for the per-event matcher breakdown.

**Per-stage imaging timing is still NOT instrumented** (the imaging nodes emit no `took`
lines — see the caveat below); the §0 numbers are whole-process only. Adding `took` timing
to `MaskSlices`/`GridTiling`/`BlobClustering`/`ChargeSolving` remains the prerequisite for a
per-stage imaging breakdown.

> **Open blocker (2026-06-05):** the full local-imaging reprocess of files 1–3 is blocked by
> an **intermittent clustering heap-corruption** in `clus_all_apa`, newly exposed by the
> richer local active imaging (segfaults on a layout-dependent ~50–70 % of runs; clean under
> gdb and in single-event isolation → a memory-corruption heisenbug, distinct from the
> already-fixed `fill_wrap_points` off-by-one). Until fixed, the §0 wall/RSS come from runs
> that happened to complete all 50 events. See the debugging trail below.
>
> **Debugging trail (what has and hasn't reproduced it) — for future work:**
> The bug is rare and layout-sensitive; every "definitive" tool so far has come up empty,
> so do **not** read these clean results as "no bug" — read them as "this probe didn't
> trip it." Catalogue of attempts on file 1 (the only file that has ever crashed; files 2–3
> = 50 events each, always clean):
> - **Native, single event 60119 in isolation:** 25/25 clean → the crash is cross-event /
>   state-dependent, not a property of one event's data.
> - **gdb:** never reproduces (layout shift hides it) — classic heisenbug signature.
> - **valgrind memcheck** (Go/gojsonnet startup noise suppressed via `go.supp`, JSON config
>   to skip the Go eval path): ~35 min run, **0 errors**. Consistent with a *within-capacity*
>   overrun (write stays inside an allocation's real heap block → invisible to memcheck).

>   file-1-alone passes **silent** → not a checked-container overrun; rules out the obvious
>   `std::vector[]` OOB family.

>   correlation from the [[fill_wrap_points OOB]] memory (crash favors busy events →

>   rebuilt with 0 `__asan` symbols).

## 1. Local-imaging per-event re-measurement (2026-06-05) — the foreign hotspots dissolve

The five "pathological" events from the foreign-input headline (below) were re-measured
under **our own local imaging**. Four already had complete timing on disk from the clean
full-file `run_local.sh` reprocesses (`f2`/`f3` rc=0, 50 evt each; `f1` 59789 from the
partial run); **61637** (never reached before the f1 heisenbug crash) and **59789** (its
on-disk number came from the crashed f1 run) were re-run **single-event in isolation**
(crash-safe: the `clus_all_apa` heisenbug is cross-event) via
`/home/xqian/tmp/lanrepro2/{mkev.sh,runev.sh}` → `f1/ev<ID>/ev.log`. 59789's single-event
total (55.2 s) matches its full-file total (54.7 s), confirming the single-event method
and validating the crashed-run number.

| rank (old) | event | file | **foreign baseline** (superseded) | **local imaging** (total clustering / ExamineBundles) |
|--:|--:|:--:|--:|--:|
| 1 | **141530** | 2 | 952 s (ExBundles 613 s) | **6.1 s** / 2.9 s |
| 2 | **59789**  | 1 | 466 s (ExBundles 239 s) | **55.2 s** / 29.7 s  *(single-event re-run; full-file 54.7 s)* |
| 3 | **138824** | 2 | 236 s (ExBundles 150 s) | **47.5 s** / 29.7 s |
| 4 | 187650 | 3 | ~92 s (ExBundles 46 s) | **56.7 s** / 39.1 s |
| 5 | 61637  | 1 | ~72 s | **4.0 s** / 2.3 s  *(single-event)* |

Per-file local-imaging totals: **f2 = 144.5 s / 50 evt, f3 = 173 s / 50 evt** (≈ 3 s/event
mean vs ≈ 17 s/event on the foreign baseline). ExamineBundles is **still the #1 stage
(50–54 %)** and still long-tailed, but the worst *single* node-pass is now ~15–20 s, not
~310 s.

**Two premises overturned.**

1. **141530 — the isochronous event in the screenshot
   (`sbnd_xin/pics/Screenshot 2026-06-05 at 6.26.44 PM.png`) — is NOT a hotspot under our
   pipeline** (6.1 s; per-node ExamineBundles 228 + 1213 + 1422 ms). The "isochronous look"
   is not what drives clustering time. The genuinely slow events are 59789 / 138824 / 187650.

2. **Neither cluster count nor blob/point count predicts ExamineBundles time.** Final live
   `nclusters` is tiny for *every* event (≤ 30; 141530 has the most at 30, yet is fastest),
   so the O(n²) cluster *pair* loop (`clustering_examine_bundles.cxx:113-129`) cannot be the
   explosion — it ranges over ≤ 30 items. And raw blob/point counts (from the active npz)
   *anti*-correlate if anything:

   | event | clustering | total points | total blobs |
   |--:|--:|--:|--:|
   | 141530 | **6.1 s** | 8853 | **9187** (most) |
   | 138824 | 47.5 s | 8178 | 6689 |
   | 187650 | 56.7 s | 7436 | 6014 |
   | 59789  | 55.2 s | 6964 | 6567 |
   | 61637  | **4.0 s** | 4939 | 2873 |

   141530 has the most blobs and points but the fastest clustering. Even within a TPC:
   141530/apa0 (5666 blobs) = 1.2 s vs 59789/apa0 (4886 blobs) = 14.6 s — comparable blob
   count, **12× the time**. So the cost is **topological** (the per-cluster
   `connected_blobs` blob-graph: edge density / how tangled the blobs are in a few large
   clusters), **not** count-driven.

**Attribution caveat (do not over-claim the 5–150× drop).** The foreign baseline and these
local runs differ in *three* uncontrolled ways — imaging input (foreign larsoft
`*-active.npz` vs our multi-3view active), code version (the `fill_wrap_points` fix landed
between), and config (foreign was auto_mask-on; `run_local.sh` is not). So treat the local
numbers as the **live-pipeline measurement that supersedes** the foreign baseline; the gap
is not attributable to any single cause. (An isolation control — current binary on foreign
141530 input — would pin imaging-vs-code, but is not needed for the optimization decision.)

### Revised optimization strategy (replaces the foreign-baseline "spatial pre-filter" plan)

The original suggestion (spatial pre-filter on the O(n²) cluster pair loop) is **misdirected**
under local imaging: with ≤ 30 final clusters that loop is negligible. The real cost is the
per-cluster `connected_blobs` (`clustering_examine_bundles.cxx:148-162` →
`Facade_Cluster.cxx:2949`) on a few large, densely-connected clusters, and it scales with
blob-graph **edge count**, not blob count.

1. **Split the ExamineBundles timer** into *pair-loop* vs *connected_blobs* (and, inside
   `connected_blobs`, graph-build vs connected-components) on one slow event (138824 —
   ExamineBundles concentrated in `apa1-0` + `clus_all_apa` ≈ 30 s). A small debug-only
   `took` timer in `MultiAlgBlobClustering.cxx` / `Facade_Cluster.cxx`; no behavior change.
   This is the prerequisite measurement — it tells us *which half* to optimize.
2. **Profile `connected_blobs` per cluster**: log per-cluster blob count + graph edge count
   + time, to confirm a handful of large tangled clusters dominate and find the edge-count
   blow-up. The blob-graph build (proximity search via the `DynamicPointCloud` kd-tree) and
   the edge set are the candidate hot loops.
3. `connected_blobs` is the **shared primitive** under Deghost / ProtectOverclustering /
   Separate (which peak on the same events), so one fix there plausibly moves all four.
4. Validate any change is **clustering-output-identical** on the quiet hand-scan events
   before trusting the tail events.

> **Resolved by §2 below (2026-06-05):** the gperftools profile of event 187650 answers
> steps 1–2 directly. The cost is **not** in `connected_components` and **not** edge-count
> per se — it is a `boost::format` scope-key string rebuilt millions of times inside
> `connect_graph_relaxed`. See §2.

## 2. Root-cause CPU profile of event 187650 (gperftools, 2026-06-05) — the real hotspot is a format() in a hot loop

**Method (no rebuild).** Ran the single-event 187650 matching graph (local active +
in-graph dead) under the gperftools CPU profiler — `LD_PRELOAD=libprofiler.so.0`,
`CPUPROFILE=cpu.prof`, `CPUPROFILE_FREQUENCY=250` — then analyzed with `google-pprof`
against `build/apps/wire-cell` (full symbols; 17434 samples ≈ 70 s CPU). Repro in
`/home/xqian/tmp/lanrepro2/f3/ev187650/` (`cpu.prof`, `evprof.log`).

**Call tree (cumulative % of whole-process CPU):**

```
MultiAlgBlobClustering              85.7%   (clustering dominates; imaging/IO are noise)
  ClusteringExamineBundles          58.9%   -> connect_graph_relaxed -> get_closest_points
      make_graph_relaxed            58.8%
        connect_graph_relaxed       57.9%   <-- the long-range "relaxed" bridging
          get_closest_points        57.6%
            kd2d                     47.3%   <-- 2D kd-tree accessor by (apa,face,plane)
              String::format        40.8%   <-- !!! boost::format rebuilding a scope key
            test_good_point         43.4% / is_good_point 19.3%
          vhough_transform          14%     <-- ALSO under connect_graph_relaxed (Hough direction)
  ProtectOverclustering             14.8%   -> Separate_overclustering -> kd2d (66% of Protect)
  ClusteringDeghost                  8.0%   -> connect_graph_ctpc -> kd2d (62% of Deghost)
```

**`kd2d` is the shared hotspot** (verified by the upward caller chain): its 47.3% splits
**ExamineBundles 71% / ProtectOverclustering 21% / Deghost 8%** (Examine & Protect reach it
via `connect_graph_relaxed`, Deghost via `connect_graph_ctpc`). So fixing `kd2d` speeds all
three at once. The other big item, `vhough_transform` (~14% here), is **also inside
`connect_graph_relaxed`** (the per-candidate Hough direction) — not a separate stage — and is
the next hotspot once the format cost is removed (see §3).

**The hotspot is `Grouping::kd2d` (`clus/src/Facade_Grouping.cxx:297-306`):**

```cpp
const Grouping::kd2d_t& Grouping::kd2d(const int apa, const int face, const int pind) const {
    std::vector<std::string> plane_names = {"U", "V", "W"};                       // heap alloc / call
    const auto sname = String::format("ctpc_a%df%dp%d", apa, face, plane_names[pind]); // line 300: 7171 samples = 41%
    Tree::Scope scope = {sname, {"x", "y"}, 1};
    const auto& sv = m_node->value.scoped_view(scope);                            // line 303: 781 samples (4.5%)
    return sv.kd();
}
```

`kd2d` is called per-point-per-plane inside `connect_graph_relaxed`'s good-point tests
(`get_closest_points` → `test_good_point`/`is_good_point`), i.e. **millions of times**, and
every call rebuilds — via slow `boost::format` — one of only **≤ 12 distinct, stable**
`(apa, face, pind)` scope keys, plus a fresh `vector<string>{"U","V","W"}`. Line 300 alone
is **41% of whole-process CPU (~48% of clustering)**; `kd2d` total is **47.3%** (the
`__dynamic_cast` 10%-self in the flat profile is *also* under `kd2d → scoped_view`).

**This explains the §1 paradox** (blob count doesn't predict time). The overhead is a flat
per-good-point-test cost, so an event's clustering time tracks **how many long-range
good-point tests `connect_graph_relaxed` performs**, which depends on cluster geometry/extent
(how much candidate bridging it probes), *not* raw blob count. The isochronous 141530 — many
blobs but geometry that triggers far fewer relaxed probes — is fast; the tangled 59789 /
138824 / 187650 probe far more.

### Fix (IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-05) — memoize the kd2d scope key

The per-call `boost::format` + `vector<string>` are replaced by a memoized, data-independent
`(apa,face,pind) → Tree::Scope` lookup (`mutable m_kd2d_scope_cache` on `Grouping`); the
`scoped_view(scope)` call is unchanged, so the tree's own kd-tree caching/invalidation — and
thus the clustering result — is **bit-identical**. Changed files:
`clus/src/Facade_Grouping.cxx` (kd2d) + `clus/inc/WireCellClus/Facade_Grouping.h` (cache member).

**Measured result** (single-event, local imaging; total = sum over all 3 MABC nodes):

| event | pre-fix | post-fix | speedup | ExamineBundles pre→post |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 187650 | 56.7 s | 26.5 s | **2.14×** | 39.1 → 17.8 s |
| 59789  | 55.2 s | 27.6 s | **2.00×** | 29.7 → 17.9 s |
| 138824 | 47.5 s | 25.1 s | **1.89×** | 29.7 → 18.0 s |
| 61637  | 4.0 s  | 2.9 s  | 1.38×    | 2.3 → 1.6 s |
| 141530 | 6.1 s  | 5.3 s  | 1.15×    | 2.9 → 2.2 s |

**Output-identical: verified** — pre-fix vs post-fix `mabc.zip` is **byte-for-byte identical**
across all Bee members on 59789, 61637 and 187650 (including the worst event). The tail events
(the ones that matter) get ~2×; the already-fast events less, because they spent proportionally
little time in the format.

**Post-fix profile** (re-run of 187650 under gperftools): `String::format` is **gone** from the
top; `kd2d` dropped **47.3% → 8.9%** (now just the legitimate `scoped_view` lookup); total CPU
samples fell ~44% (17434 → ~9840), consistent with the ~2× wall speedup. The new top clustering
costs are genuine work — `vhough_transform` (now ~31%, the boost::histogram Hough in
Separate/Protect) and `nanoflann` kd-tree neighbour searches (~14%) — which are the next targets.

## 3. Next hotspot after the kd2d fix: `vhough_transform` (post-fix profile of 187650, 2026-06-05)

Re-profiling 187650 **after** the kd2d fix (`cpu_postfix.prof`; 9844 samples) shows the new
clustering shape — ExamineBundles is still #1 (61%), and inside its `connect_graph_relaxed`
the cost is now genuine geometry, dominated by one item:

```
ClusteringExamineBundles               61.0%
  connect_graph_relaxed                58.6%
    vhough_transform / hough_transform 30.9%   <-- #1 remaining: per-candidate Hough direction
        std::max_element               20.1%   (65% of vhough)  <-- scans ALL histogram bins
        boost::histogram::fill         19.5% (of vhough)
    get_closest_points (good-point)    27.5%
        nanoflann kd-tree search       14.3%   <-- #2 remaining: genuine radius queries
ProtectOverclustering                   9.5%
ClusteringDeghost                       4.6%
```

**Root cause of `vhough_transform`** (`clus/src/Facade_Cluster.cxx:1609-1680`,
`hough_transform`): it builds a **180 × 360 = 64 800-bin** `boost::histogram` with the
**default `unlimited_storage`** (an adaptive type-erased *variant* per bin), fills only the
handful of points within the search radius, then finds the peak with

```cpp
auto hist = bh::make_histogram(bh::axis::regular<>(180,...), bh::axis::regular<>(360,...));
... // fill ~few hundred points
auto indexed = bh::indexed(hist);
auto it = std::max_element(indexed.begin(), indexed.end());   // scans ALL 64 800 bins
```

So the histogram is **sparse to fill but the peak-scan is full-grid**, and every one of the
64 800 `max_element` comparisons dispatches through `unlimited_storage::buffer_type::visit` (a
std::variant visit — 31% self time). `max_element` is **65% of `vhough_transform`**. This is
called once per relaxed-bridging candidate inside `connect_graph_relaxed`.

### Fixes (IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-05) — four output-identical optimizations, cumulative ~3.2–3.5×

All four target pure overhead in `connect_graph_relaxed`'s inner work and are verified
**byte-identical (CRC-32 `mabc.zip`) against the original pre-any-fix baseline** on 59789 /
61637 / 187650:

1. **kd2d scope-key memo** (§2) — `boost::format` → cached `Tree::Scope`.
2. **Hough dense storage** — `bh::make_histogram_with(bh::dense_storage<double>(), …)` so the
   `max_element` comparisons are scalar, not `std::variant` visits.
3. **Hough sparse peak** — replace the dense `boost::histogram` entirely: accumulate weights
   into an `unordered_map` keyed by inner-bin linear index and take the peak over only the
   touched bins (O(#points) not O(64 800)), killing both the per-call 64 800-double zero-fill
   and the full-grid scan. Binning uses `axis::regular::index()`; the tie-break is reproduced
   as smallest `lin = i + j*nbins1` (boost `indexed` advances axis-0 fastest) → bit-identical.
   (`clus/src/Facade_Cluster.cxx`, `hough_transform`.)
4. **Good-point existence query** — the good-point tests
   (`is_good_point`/`is_good_point_wc`/`test_good_point`) only use
   `get_closest_points(...).size() > 0`, so they now call a new `Grouping::has_closest_point`
   that does a single `knn(1)` nearest-neighbour query and checks `dist < radius²` (strict, to
   match nanoflann's `RadiusResultSet`) instead of collecting every in-radius point.
   (`clus/src/Facade_Grouping.cxx` + header.)

**Measured progression** (single-event, local imaging; total = sum over 3 MABC nodes):

| event | original | +kd2d | +Hough dense | +Hough sparse | **+knn good-point** | total vs original |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 187650 | 56.7 s | 26.5 s | 22.1 s | 19.2 s | **16.9 s** | **3.35×** |
| 59789  | 55.2 s | 27.6 s | 23.2 s | 20.1 s | **15.9 s** | **3.47×** |
| 138824 | 47.5 s | 25.1 s | 20.1 s | 17.1 s | **14.7 s** | **3.23×** |
| 61637  | 4.0 s  | 2.9 s  | 2.7 s  | 2.6 s  | **2.4 s**  | 1.67× |
| 141530 | 6.1 s  | 5.3 s  | 4.9 s  | 4.9 s  | **4.9 s**  | 1.24× |

**Post-all-four profile** (187650, `cpu_v4.prof`): total CPU samples **17 434 → 5 463** (3.2×
fewer). `vhough_transform` is down to ~10% (from 31%); the variant-visit and the 64 800-bin
zero-fill/scan are gone.

### Remaining hotspots / next targets

1. **(~12–14%) `kd2d` → `scoped_view` lookup.** With the format gone, the residual `kd2d` cost
   is the `scoped_view(scope)` hash-lookup. **Cache the `kd2d_t&` reference** by
   `(apa,face,pind)` to skip it — *only* if verified the scoped view is not invalidated between
   calls within a clustering pass (else keep the current safe Scope-only memo). Now the single
   biggest remaining lever.
2. **(~13%) `nanoflann` kd-tree traversal** (`searchLevel`) under the `knn`/`radius` queries —
   genuine geometry; algorithmic only.
3. **(~15% spread) small-vector allocations** in `NFKDVec::Tree::knn`/`radius` (per-call
   `indices`/`distances`/result vectors). A `k=1` fast path with stack buffers would cut the
   `malloc`/`free` churn the existence query now shows.

> Validate any of these the same way: **byte-identical `mabc.zip`** (CRC-32) on
> 59789 / 61637 / 187650 vs the original baseline, then re-pull per-event timing.

## 4. Follow-up on the three §3 next-targets (2026-06-05) — one kept, two findings

The three "next targets" above were each investigated. **Only one was a safe win; the other
two are findings (one unsafe, one no-benefit) — kept here so they are not re-attempted.**
All kept changes remain **byte-identical (CRC-32 `mabc.zip`)** to the original pre-any-fix
baseline on 59789 / 61637 / 187650.

1. **`k=1` stack fast path in `NFKDVec::Tree::knn` — KEPT (output-identical).** The good-point
   existence query calls `knn(1)` millions of times; each call heap-allocated two 1-element
   scratch vectors (`indices`, `distances`). Added a `kay == 1` branch that uses stack scalars
   and `nanoflann` writes the same index+distance → bit-identical. Plus, the two hot kd2d
   query helpers (`has_closest_point`, `get_closest_points`) built a `std::vector<double>{x,y}`
   query and a `std::vector<double>` `angles` per call — both replaced with stack
   `std::array` (`Facade_Grouping.cxx`). (`util/inc/WireCellUtil/NFKDVec.h`,
   `clus/src/Facade_Grouping.cxx`.)

2. **`kd2d` → `scoped_view` ref-cache (the §3 #1 lever) — NOT DONE, proven UNSAFE.** The plan
   was to cache the `kd2d_t&` reference per `(apa,face,pind)` to skip the `scoped_view()`
   hash-lookup. **Settled empirically, not by reasoning:** a temporary per-tree counter in
   `Tree::Points::rebuild_indices` (env-gated `WC_REBUILD_COUNT`) showed each `ctpc_a*f*p*`
   scope is **invalidated and rebuilt 3× within a single tree's lifetime** on 187650 — the
   clustering passes (ExamineBundles / Protect / Deghost) reinsert blob nodes at the scope
   depth, firing `on_insert` → `indices_valid = false`. The residual `scoped_view()` call **is**
   that invalidation safety net (`get_scoped` → `!indices_valid` → `rebuild_indices`). A bare
   ref-cache would bypass it and use a **stale kd-tree** → wrong output on merge-heavy events
   (a data-dependent failure CRC-on-3-events would not necessarily catch). *A safe version
   exists but is larger:* cache the `ScopedView*` + its `indices_valid` flag per key and still
   honor invalidation (skipping only the Scope **hash**, not the rebuild) — needs a new
   `PointTree::Points` accessor. Left as the documented next lever (see below).

3. **`nanoflann` leaf-size tuning (the §3 #2 lever) — NOT DONE, no robust benefit.** `searchLevel`
   is an *exact* search, so `leaf_max_size` changes traversal but never results. Swept
   `leaf_max_size ∈ {4,6,8,10,16,24,32}` on 187650 (env-gated `WC_NFKD_LEAF`): total clustering
   was **16.4–17.6 s**, with the default 10 already at 16.6 s and the spread inside the ~0.2 s
   run-to-run jitter (larger leaves regressed). The "~14% `searchLevel`" is genuine, irreducible
   2-D nearest-neighbour geometry; the default leaf is near-optimal. Not worth a global change
   to a shared primitive. (Both knobs reverted; only change #1 above shipped.)

**Measured (single-event, local imaging; total over 3 MABC nodes), vs the §3 post-four state:**

| event | §3 (+knn) | **+`k=1` stack + array query** | total vs original |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 187650 | 16.9 s | **16.2 s** | **3.5×** |
| 59789  | 15.9 s | **15.0 s** | **3.7×** |
| 61637  | 2.4 s  | **2.4 s**  | 1.67× |

The k=1/array allocation removal is a small further gain (near the noise floor on the busy
events) but harmless and output-identical.

### Refreshed next-hotspots (gperftools `cpu_v6.prof`, 187650, 2026-06-05)

Total CPU samples **17 434 (original) → 5 237** (3.3× fewer). `MultiAlgBlobClustering` = 81.7 %
of process; the rest is QLMatching light prediction (`SemiAnalyticalModel`) + IO. Within
clustering, `ClusteringExamineBundles` (44.7 %) → `connected_blobs` → `connect_graph_relaxed`
(41.3 %) still dominates. Ranked remaining levers:

1. **(~16 %) `scoped_view` Scope-hash lookup** inside `has_closest_point` — the biggest single
   lever (dominated by `_M_find_node` hashing the `Scope` string). The **safe** optimization is
   the larger one in finding #2 above (cache `ScopedView*`+validity, skip only the hash). The
   naive ref-cache is ruled out.
2. **(~14 %) `nanoflann::searchLevel`** — genuine geometry, irreducible (finding #3).
3. **(~10 %) `hough_transform`** via `Separate_overclustering` (Protect) — already sparse; the
   residual is the per-candidate direction-accumulation loop itself, not storage.
4. **(~8 %) `get_closest_dead_chs`** — per-good-point dead-channel `ch`-range scan with a map
   lookup per channel; a tighter early-out or a denser per-plane structure could trim it.
5. **(~14 % spread) `malloc`/`free`** — remaining churn is the `knn` result vector and
   `DynamicPointCloud` growth, not the now-removed query scratch.

## 5. The `scoped_view` fast path — the safe form of the §4 #1 lever (2026-06-05)

The §4 #1 lever (the `scoped_view` Scope-hash, ~16 %) is now **captured, output-identical**.
The naive ref-cache stays ruled out; this is the safe form, gated on two empirical facts
established with temporary env-gated counters (since reverted):

- **`indices_valid` is the authority.** `Tree::Points::on_insert`/`on_remove` clear
  `m_scoped[scope].indices_valid` **unconditionally** on any tree change, and `ScopedView::kd()`
  lazily rebuilds its `m_nfkd` when its selections change. So `indices_valid == true` ⟹ nothing
  was inserted/removed since the last resolve ⟹ the view's k-d tree is current.
- **ctpc scoped views are never erased.** A per-`(tree,scope)` creation counter showed each
  `ctpc_a*f*p*` `ScopedView` is created **exactly once** per tree (`create_count == 1`) on 187650
  — `on_remove` (which *would* erase a scope and dangle a cached pointer) never fires for these
  scopes. So the `ScopedView*` and the `&indices_valid` flag are **stable for the tree's life**.

**Implementation.** A new accessor `Tree::Points::scoped_indices_valid(scope)` returns a stable
`const bool*` to the flag (`util/{inc/WireCellUtil/PointTree.h,src/PointTree.cxx}`). `Grouping`'s
per-`(apa,face,pind)` memo now also caches the resolved `ScopedView*` + that flag pointer
(`Facade_Grouping.{h,cxx}`). `kd2d()` fast-paths: when the flag is true it returns
`sv->kd()` directly — **no `Scope` hash, no `dynamic_cast`, no rebuild check**; when false (or on
the first call) it falls back to `scoped_view()`, which rebuilds/revalidates, and re-caches the
(stable) pointers. The flag goes false only on the ~3 invalidations/tree, so the slow path is rare.

**Measured (single-event, local imaging; total over 3 MABC nodes), CRC-identical `mabc.zip` to the
original baseline on all three:**

| event | §4 (k=1+array) | **+`scoped_view` fast path** | total vs original |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 187650 | 16.2 s | **13.5 s** | **4.2×** |
| 59789  | 15.0 s | **12.6 s** | **4.4×** |
| 138824 | 14.7 s | **12.1 s** | **3.9×** |
| 61637  | 2.4 s  | **2.3 s**  | 1.7× |

(CRC-identity verified on 187650 / 59789 / 61637, which have saved original-baseline
`mabc.zip`; 138824 is a timing-only re-run.)

This is the largest single win since the §2 `kd2d` format fix. Profile (`cpu_v7.prof`, 187650):
total samples **5 237 → 4 689** (original 17 434 → **3.7× fewer**); `scoped_view` **16.1 % → 3.7 %**,
the `_M_find_node` Scope hashing **9.4 % → 4.8 %**; `kd2d` is no longer a top frame.

### Refreshed next-hotspots (`cpu_v7.prof`, 187650)

The hot path is now dominated by genuine geometry, not bookkeeping:

1. **(~15 %) `nanoflann::searchLevel`** under `knn` — now the single biggest lever, and
   **irreducible** (exact search; the §4 leaf-size sweep found no robust gain). Algorithmic only.
2. **(~11 %) `hough_transform`** via `Separate_overclustering` (Protect) — already sparse; the
   residual is the per-candidate direction-accumulation loop itself.
3. **(~9 %) `get_closest_dead_chs`** — per-good-point dead-channel `ch`-range scan, one map lookup
   per channel; relatively grew as the others shrank. A tighter early-out / denser per-plane
   structure could trim it. Best *bookkeeping* lever left.
4. **(~15 % spread) `malloc`/`free`** — `knn` result vector + `DynamicPointCloud` growth.

## How it was measured

Each `MultiAlgBlobClustering` node logs `MABC timing: <Stage>:<scope> took <ms> ms`
per clustering method per event. The parser (`sbnd_xin/clustering_timing_analysis.py`)
attributes every timing line to its MABC node instance (`apa0-0`, `apa1-0` = per-TPC;
`clus_all_apa` = all-APA merge) and to the event ident currently loaded in that node,
then aggregates. Run:

```
python3 timing_analysis.py f1/match_f1_fixed.log f2on/match.log f3on/match.log
```

(one non-overlapping log per file: file 1 from the complete `f1off` run, files 2–3
from `f2on`/`f3on`). Re-run against the final `f{1,2,3}on/match.log` once the
auto_mask-on reprocess finishes for the locked numbers.

**Caveat — imaging is NOT in this profile.** The live (active) clusters are read from
pre-imaged `icluster-apa*-active.npz`; the dead (masked) view is imaged in-graph but
emits no `took` lines. So this is a *clustering* profile only. To profile imaging
per-event, the imaging stages (`MaskSlices`/`GridTiling`/`BlobClustering`/
`PointTreeBuilding`) need the same `took`-style instrumentation MABC has — **a small
follow-up worth doing** before optimizing imaging, since right now we are blind to it.

## Headline: one stage and a handful of events dominate

> **⚠ SUPERSEDED (2026-06-05) — foreign-input baseline.** The numbers in this section were
> measured on yuhw's foreign larsoft `*-active.npz` (pre-`fill_wrap_points`-fix, auto_mask-on)
> and are kept only for history/comparison. Under our own local imaging the per-event times

Total clustering wall summed over all 150 events: **~2589 s**.

| stage | total | share | worst single event |
|---|--:|--:|---|
| **ClusteringExamineBundles** | **1536 s** | **59 %** | **310 s** (ev 141530, apa0-0) |
| ClusteringProtectOverclustering | 432 s | 17 % | 171 s (ev 141530) |
| ClusteringDeghost | 366 s | 14 % | 164 s (ev 141530) |
| ClusteringSeparate | 123 s | 5 % | 73 s (ev 59789) |
| ClusteringExtendLoop | 41 s | 2 % | 1.1 s |
| ClusteringConnect1 | 35 s | 1 % | 1.0 s |
| (all others) | ~58 s | 2 % | <0.5 s each |

**Top 4 stages = ~95 % of all clustering time.** Everything below ExtendLoop is noise.

### The work is concentrated in a few pathological events

| rank | event ident | file | total clustering | dominant stage |
|--:|--:|:--:|--:|---|
| 1 | **141530** | 2 | **952 s** | ExamineBundles 613 s |
| 2 | **59789** | 1 | **466 s** | ExamineBundles 239 s |
| 3 | **138824** | 2 | **236 s** | ExamineBundles 150 s |
| 4 | 187650 | 3 | ~92 s | ExamineBundles 46 s |
| 5 | 61637 | 1 | ~72 s | ExamineBundles 48 s |
| … | | | | |

**One event (141530) = ~37 % of the entire clustering wall; the top 3 events = ~64 %.**
The median event is a few seconds; the mean is dragged up entirely by this tail. Every
slow event is ExamineBundles-dominated — the busy cosmic pile-up events where the
per-TPC cluster/blob count blows up. (Note the worst event shifted from 59789 to 141530
vs the mid-run snapshot: the tail is driven by individual dense events, so the exact
ranking moves but the shape — one stage, a few events — is invariant.)

### Per-node (per-MABC-instance) share

| node | share | note |
|---|--:|---|
| `apa0-0` (TPC 0) | ~46 % | consistently slower than TPC 1 — and it owns the worst event 59789 |
| `clus_all_apa` (all-APA merge) | ~28 % | second full clustering pass over the merged both-TPC tree |
| `apa1-0` (TPC 1) | ~26 % | |

## Why ClusteringExamineBundles is the hotspot (starting point for tomorrow)

> **⚠ Partially revised by §1 (2026-06-05).** Direction #1 below (spatial pre-filter on the
> O(n²) pair loop) is the wrong target under local imaging — final `nclusters` ≤ 30, so that
> loop is negligible. The cost is the per-cluster `connected_blobs` (#2), and it scales with
> blob-graph *edge density*, not raw blob count (see §1's count tables). Use §1's strategy.

Source: `clus/src/clustering_examine_bundles.cxx` (see also the algorithm review
`clus/docs/clustering/review_neutrino_isolated_examine_bundles.md`). Two structural
costs that scale badly with cluster/blob count:

1. **O(n²) pairwise cluster loop** (`:113–129`): `for i … for j=i+1 …` over
   `pre_clusters`, building the connectivity graph. Quadratic in the number of
   pre-clusters — on a dense event with many clusters this is the explosion.
2. **Per-cluster blob-graph build** (`:148–162`): `live_clusters[i]->connected_blobs(dv, pcts, graph_name)`
   for every cluster — builds/walks a per-cluster blob graph; cost grows with blobs
   per cluster.

Likely-fruitful directions (to evaluate tomorrow, none done yet):
- **Spatial pre-filter on the O(n²) pair loop** — skip cluster pairs whose bounding
  boxes / drift-time spans cannot connect, so `j` only ranges over near neighbours
  (turn O(n²) into ~O(n·k)). Biggest expected win on the tail events.
- **Profile `connected_blobs`** itself (it recurs in Deghost and Separate too — see
  below) — it is the shared primitive under the top-4 stages, so speeding it helps
  broadly.
- **Cache/reuse** geometry the pairwise loop recomputes per (i,j).

The next tier — **ProtectOverclustering, Deghost, Separate** (together ~37 %) — also
peak on the same events (59789), which strongly suggests a **shared underlying
primitive** (blob connectivity / point-cloud distance queries via `connected_blobs` /
`DynamicPointCloud`) rather than four independent problems. Optimizing that primitive
is plausibly a single change that moves all four. (Note: the crash fix committed today
was in exactly this primitive — `DynamicPointCloud::fill_wrap_points` — so it is
already on the radar.)

## Suggested order for tomorrow

1. **Instrument imaging** with `took` timing (we are currently blind to it).
2. **Re-pull locked numbers** from the finished `f{1,2,3}on` logs.
3. **Attack ExamineBundles** first (56 %): spatial pre-filter on the `:113–129` pair
   loop; profile `connected_blobs`.
4. Check whether the shared connectivity primitive explains the ProtectOverclustering
   / Deghost / Separate tail — one fix may cover all four.
5. Validate any change is **clustering-output-identical** on the 10 hand-scan events
   before trusting it on the tail events.
6. **Follow-up on today's `fill_wrap_points` crash fix** (`DynamicPointCloud.cxx:964`):
   the fix restores the documented `wires_all.size() - 1` clamp (a strict improvement —
   it converts an out-of-bounds read into the long-standing pre-2025-07-28 behavior). But
   the *correctness* of clamping when `point2wind` overshoots is a pre-existing question:
   log `wind - wires_all.size()` where the clamp fires. If it is always ~+1 these are
   genuine edge-of-plane points and clamping to the last wire is right; if it is *large*,
   `point2wind` may have a coordinate/pitch mismatch and the clamped wire is arbitrary on
   exactly the busy events — i.e. non-crashing but subtly wrong. This session verified
   non-crash on all 150 events and byte-identical matched output on the quiet hand-scans
   (where the clamp does not fire), but did NOT separately verify the clamp value on the
   busy tail.
