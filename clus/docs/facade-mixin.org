#+title: Facade's Mixin

A class inherits a "mixin" in order to gain a "bag of methods".  In
~Facade_Util.h~ the ~Mixin~ class provides common methods to ~Grouping~, ~Cluster~ and
~Blob~ facades that cover these features:

- Access to the "local PCs" (point cloud datasets and their arrays).  Users of
  the facades should learn about this and avoid reinventing PC access methods.

- A systemic, hermetic but monolithic caching mechanism.  Developers of the
  facades should learn about this.

More information is in the ~Facade_Util.h~ comments.
